# event-sourcing-saga-comparison

- The idea behind this project is to do a comparison between implementation Event sourcing compared to Saga design pattern.
- This shows comparison for just one of many implementation and is for learning purposes, it does not show absolute advanatages and disadvantages for these design patterns, but only for this concrete implementations of there of.

# Saga 

- To solve microservice atomicity problem transaction logs are going to be saved and a state machine is going to be implemented for transaction handling.
- Data included in transaction is going to be locked in perspective databases once transaction starts and operations regarding them are going to be idempotent.
- Rollback scenarios are going to need to be implemented and initial data is going to need to be saved for rollback scenarios.

# Event sourcing

- Events (only source of truth) with object aggregates are going to be generated and saved in a batch which would be an atomic operation by which other operations are going to be triggered. 
- By having main source of truth, jobs(operations) can reocurr and eventually provide a consisten state.  
- For real time information, data can be generated by calculating final state from events.

- Having dirty reads and/or phatnom reads
- Locking resources - too heavy -
